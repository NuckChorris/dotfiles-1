vim custom files
----------------
Various files relating to vim configuration. They are:
* .vimrc : main vim configuration file. To be placed in ~.
* colorscheme.vim : custom vim colorscheme which uses only the terminal's colors. To be placed in /usr/share/vim/vim73/colors. 
* powerline.vim : custom Powerline colorscheme using only the terminal's colors, instead of preset ones like the default. To be placed in ~/.vim/bundles/vim-powerline/autoload/Powerline/Colorschemes

You can give the colorscheme files any name you want, but make sure to replace their names in your .vimrc. An example of that can be found in my .vimrc file; both of my files are named "custom".
