This is a set of themes for use with Gnome Shell 3.6.2. It is based off Faience, with entirely different window decorations and adapted GTK themes, and a slightly tweaked shell theme.

Installation
============
Clone the entire hdni directory into ~/.themes or /usr/share/themes and set the theme through the Gnome Tweak Tool.
