Different configurations files, mainly for a GNU/Linux environment.

Note that the "hdni" directory contains a suite of themes for Gnome Shell, Metacity, GTK2 and GTK3. I didn't change the name of the directory to something more self-evident, because the name of the theme itself is hdni, and changing it would have caused problems when setting it.
