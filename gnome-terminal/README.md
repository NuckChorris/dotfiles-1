gnome-terminal profile
----------------------
This is my profile for gnome-terminal. It includes all of my settings and colorscheme. To import it into gnome-terminal, clone the gnome-terminal-conf.xml file to any location and run:
    gconftool-2 --load gnome-terminal-conf.xml
Note that this will overwrite all of your previous settings.

If you don't use gnome-terminal, the colorscheme can still be found in the file, on line 421, in traditional order.
