My tmux config file. Some settings are personal, like the terminal name and default shell, so you may have to modify those values.
**Note:** Be sure to patch your terminal font for Powerline, since this configuation makes use of the Powerline arrow glyphs. You can use this font patcher to do it automatically for you:
